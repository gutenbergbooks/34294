<h2>GILBERT WHITE AND &ldquo;SELBORNE.&rdquo;</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">

</div>
<p>SUPPOSE that a habit of minute
observation of nature is one of
the most difficult things to
acquire, as it is one which is
less generally pursued than any
other study. In almost all departments
of learning and investigation there have
been numberless works published to illustrate
them, and text books would fill
the shelves of a large library. Thoreau
in his &ldquo;Walden&rdquo; has shown an extremely
fine and close observation of the scenes
in which his all too short life was
passed, but his object does not seem at
any time to have been the study of
nature from an essential love of it, or
to add to his own or the world&#8217;s knowledge.
On the contrary, nature was the
one resource which enabled him to
exemplify his notions of independence,
which were of such a sturdy and uncompromising
character that Mr.
Emerson, who had suffered some inconvenience
from his experience of
Thoreau as an inmate of his household,
thought him fitter to meet occasionally
in the open air than as a guest at
table and fireside. There is a delicious
harmony with nature in all that he has
written, but his descriptions of out-of-door
life invite us rather to indolent
musing than to investigation or study.
Who after reading Izaak Walton ever
went a-fishing with the vigor and enterprise
of Piscator? Washington Irving
allowed his cork to drift with the
current and lay down in the shadow of
a spreading oak to dream with the beloved
old author.</p>

<p>In White&#8217;s &ldquo;Natural History of Selborne&rdquo; we
have a unique book
indeed, but of a far more general
interest than its title would indicate.
Pliny, the elder, was the father of
natural history but to many of us Gilbert
White is entitled to that honor. To
an early edition of the book, without
engravings, and much abridged, as
compared with Bohn&#8217;s, published in
1851, many owe their first interest in
the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Ireland in his charming little
&ldquo;Book Lover&#8217;s Enchiridion,&rdquo; tells us
that when a boy he was so delighted
with it, that in order to possess a copy
of his own (books were not so cheap
as now) he actually copied out the
whole work. In a list of one hundred
books, Sir John Lubbock mentions
it as &ldquo;an inestimable blessing.&rdquo;
Edward Jesse, author
of &ldquo;Gleanings in Natural History&rdquo; attributes
his own pursuits as an out-door naturalist
entirely to White&#8217;s example. Much
of the charm of the book consists in
the amiable character of the author, who</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;lived in solitude, midst trees and flowers,<br />
Life&#8217;s sunshine mingling with its passing showers;<br />
No storms to startle, and few clouds to shade<br />
The even path his Christian virtues made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very little is known of him beyond
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>what he has chosen to mention in his
diaries, which were chiefly records of
his daily studies and observations, and
in his correspondence, from which the
&ldquo;history&rdquo; is in fact made up. From
these it is evident that his habits were
secluded and that he was strongly
attached to the charms of rural life.
He says the greater part of his time
was spent in literary occupations, and
especially in the study of nature. He
was born July 18, 1720, in the house
in which he died. His father was his
first instructor in natural history, and
to his brother Thomas, a fellow of the
Royal Society, he was indebted for
many suggestions for his work. It
is also to his brother&#8217;s influence that
we owe the publication of the book, as
it required much persuasion to induce
the philosopher to pass through the
ordeal of criticism, &ldquo;having a great
dread of Reviewers,&rdquo; those incorrigible
<em>b&ecirc;tes noires</em> of authors. His brother
promising himself to review the work
in the &ldquo;Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine,&rdquo; White
reluctantly consented to its publication.
The following short abstract from the
review will show its quality, as well as
suggest a possible answer to the current
question propounded by students of the
census.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contemplative persons see with
regret the country more and more
deserted every day, as they know that
every well-regulated family of property
which quits a village to reside in a
town, injures the place that is forsaken
in material circumstances. It is with
pleasure, therefore, we observe that so
rational an employment of leisure hours
as the study of nature promises to
become popular, since whatever adds
to the number of rural amusements,
and consequently counteracts the
allurements of the metropolis is, on this
consideration, of national importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is to be feared, however, that
many stronger influences than this of
the study of nature will be necessary
to keep the young men of the present
day from the great cities. Indeed,
modern naturalists themselves spend
the greater part of their lives at the
centers of knowledge and only make
temporary sallies into the woods and
fields to gather data. White was
a noble pioneer. The very minuteness&mdash;almost
painful&mdash;of his observation
required him to occupy
himself for days and weeks and
months with what to the average
mind would seem of the slightest
importance. As an example of
his patient investigation, his famous
study of the tortoise may
be given. It was more than thirty years
old when it came into his possession,
and for many years&mdash;perhaps twenty&mdash;we
find White watching the habits
of the interesting old reptile, until, we
may assume, he knew all about him
and his species.</p>

<p>There are over three hundred and
fifty different species of animals and
birds treated by White, most of them
exhaustively; the beech tree, the elm,
and the oak are described and watched
from year to year; and the geology
and fossil remains of Selborne district
are presented. We have daily accounts
of the weather, information of the first
tree in leaf, the appearance of the first
fungi and the plants first in blossom.
He tells us when mosses vegetate, when
insects first appear and disappear,
when birds are first seen and when
they migrate&mdash;and a thousand other
things; all in a style of such simplicity,
united with rare scholarship, that it is
well worth the attention and imitation
of students of the English
language. White was educated at
Oxford. He had frequent opportunities,
&#8217;tis said, of accepting college livings,
but his fondness for his native village
made him decline all preferment. To
this we owe &ldquo;Selborne&rdquo; of which Dr.
Beardmore, a distinguished scholar,
made the prophetic remark to a
nephew of White&#8217;s: &ldquo;Your uncle has
sent into the world a publication with
nothing to attract attention to it but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
an advertisement or two in the newspapers;
but depend upon it, the time
will come when very few who buy
books will be without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The village was far less attractive
than our imaginations would depict it
to have been, and the traveler who
would &ldquo;view fair Selborne aright,&rdquo;
according to a contemporary writer,
should humor the caprices of the
English climate and visit it only when
its fields and foliage are clothed in
their summer verdure.</p>

<h2>A FRIEND OF BIRDS</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 38px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="38" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>T is told of George H. Corliss, the
famous engine builder of Providence,
R. I., that when building
a foundry at the Corliss
works, some Blue Birds took
the opportunity to build in some holes
in the interior framework into which
horizontal timbers were to go. The
birds flew in and out&mdash;as Blue Birds
will&mdash;and went on with their housekeeping,
until in the natural course of
things the workmen would have
evicted them to put the apertures to
their intended use of receiving timbers.
But Mr. Corliss interfered and showed
how the particular aperture the birds
were occupying could be left undisturbed
until they were done with it,
without any serious delay to the building.
So the pair came and went in
the midst of the noise of building and
brought up their little family safely,
and after they had flown away, and
not until then, that particular part of
the framework was completed.</p>

<p>At another time, Mr. Corliss was
working on a contract with the city of
Providence to supply a steam pumping
apparatus, power house and all, at
Sockonosset, and the time was short,
and there were forfeitures nominated
in the bond for every day beyond a
a specified date for its completion.</p>

<p>The power house was to be upon
virgin soil where were rocks and trees&mdash;little
trees growing among rocks.
In blasting and clearing the necessary
place for the foundations of the building,
a Robin&#8217;s nest was discovered in
a little tree within the space where the
upheavals were to be made. When
Mr. Corliss knew this he had the work
transferred to the other side of the
square or parallelogram around which
the digging and blasting were to go,
saying that it was just as well to do
the other side first.</p>

<p>But it proved that when the workmen
had got clear around and back
to the Robin&#8217;s tree, the young birds
were still not quite ready to fly. This
called for a new exercise of an inventor&#8217;s
power of adapting means to a
worthy end. Looking at the little
tree with its nest and little birds high
in the branches he bade the men support
the tree carefully while it was
sawed through the trunk a little above
the ground, and then carry it in an
upright position to a safe distance and
stick it into the ground with proper
support.</p>

<p>The Robin family continued to
thrive after this novel house-moving
and all flew away together after a few
more days.</p>

<h2>QUEER DOINGS OF A CRANE.</h2>

<p>WRITER on &ldquo;Animal Helpers and Servers&rdquo; gives
a remarkable account of a
tame Crane, communicated
by Von Seyffert.
Von Seyffert had a pair of tame Cranes
which soon lost all fear of man and of
domestic animals, and became strongly
attached to the former. Their life in
a German village, in which agriculture
was the sole employment and the communal
system of joint herding of
cattle and swine and driving them
together to the common pasture prevailed,
was very much to their taste.
They soon knew all the inhabitants in
the place and used to call regularly
at the houses to be fed. Then the
female died and the survivor at once
took as a new friend a bull. He stood
by the bull in the stall and kept the
flies off him, screamed when he roared,
danced before him and followed him
out with the herd. In this association
the Crane learned the duties of cowherd,
so that one evening he brought
home the whole of the village herd of
heifers unaided and drove them into
the stable. From that time the Crane
undertook so many duties that he was
busy from dawn till night. He acted
as policeman among the poultry,
stopping all fights and disorder. He
stood by a horse when left in a cart
and prevented it from moving by
pecking its nose and screaming. A
Turkey and a Game Cock were found
fighting, whereon the Crane first fought
the Turkey, then sought out and
thrashed the cock. Meantime it
herded the cattle, not always with
complete success. The bovines were
collected in the morning by the sound
of a horn and some would lag behind.
On one occasion the Crane went back,
drove up some lagging heifers through
the street and then frightened them
so much that they broke away and ran
two miles in the wrong direction. The
bird could not bring them back, but
drove them into a field, where it
guarded them until they were fetched.
It would drive out trespassing cattle
as courageously as a dog and, unlike
most busybodies, was a universal favorite
and pride of the village.&mdash;<em>Cornhill
Magazine.</em></p>

<h2>THE LEAST BITTERN.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HROUGHOUT the whole of
temperate North America and
tropical America to Brazil,
this, the smallest of the Bittern
family, is a well-known bird, but being
a nocturnal species, inhabiting the
almost inaccessible swamps and boggy
lands that are covered with a dense
growth of canes, reeds, and rushes, it
is seldom met with. Mr. Davis calls
it an extremely interesting little bird,
of quiet, retiring habits. In some
places as many as a dozen or twenty
pairs breed along the grassy shores of
a small lake or pond. The nest is
placed on the ground or in the
midst of the rankest grass, or in a
bush. It is often placed on floating
bog, and is simply a platform of dead
rushes.</p>

<p>This bird has many odd habits.
When standing on the edge of a stream,
with its neck drawn in, it is often
taken for a Woodcock, the long bill
giving it this appearance. It is so
stupid at times that it may be caught
with the hand.</p>

<p>The Least Bittern is usually seen
just before or after sunset. When
startled it utters a low <em>gua</em>, and in daylight
flies but a short distance, in a
weak, uncertain manner, but at dusk
it flaps along on strong easy wing,
with neck drawn in and legs extended.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are usually
from two to six in number, and of a
pale bluish or greenish-white. If
approached while on the nest, the
female generally steps quietly to one
side, but if suddenly surprised, takes
to flight.</p>

<p>The Least Bittern is known by
many local names. In Jamaica it is
called Tortoise-shell Bird and Minute
Bittern, and in many localities Little
Bittern.</p>

<h2>THE BALDPATE DUCK.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&ldquo;There seem to be as many
Ducks as there are Owls,&rdquo; remarks
Bobbie. &ldquo;This fellow is
called Baldpate, but he&#8217;s not
bare on top of his head like
Gran&#8217;pa, at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, his head is feathered as
well as any Duck&#8217;s head,&rdquo;
replies mamma. &ldquo;I remember
hearing him called the Widgeon,
I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&#8217;s what it says here,
the American Widgeon, a game
bird, you know, mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, its flesh is very delicious,
almost as good as the Canvas-back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but these Baldpates are
cunning fellows,&rdquo; exclaims Bobbie,
continuing his reading, &ldquo;It
says they are fond of a certain
grass plant which grows deep in
both salt and fresh water, but
they don&#8217;t dive for it as the
Canvas-back and other deep
water Ducks do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; says mamma, as
Bobbie stops, his lips moving,
but uttering no sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stopped to spell a word,&rdquo;
explains Bobbie. &ldquo;It says they
closely follow and watch the
Canvas-back and other Ducks,
and when they rise to the surface
of the water with the roots
of the plant in their bills, Mr.
Baldpate quickly snatches a
part, or all of the catch, and
hurries off to eat it at his
leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mean fellow, indeed,&rdquo; remarks
mamma, &ldquo;but he has no
reason to guide him, as you
have, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I <em>don&#8217;t</em> know,&rdquo; quickly
says Bobbie. &ldquo;You remember
that story about the imprisoned
Duck that had its leg broken
and was put under a small crate,
or coop, to keep it from running
about? Well, some of the other
Ducks pitied the little prisoner
and tried to release him by forcing
their necks under the crate
and thus lifting it up. They
found they weren&#8217;t strong enough
to do that, and so they <em>quacked</em>,
and <em>quacked</em>, and <em>quacked</em> among
themselves, then marched away
in a body. Soon they came back
with forty ducks, every one in
the farm yard. They surrounded
the crate and tried to
lift it as before, but again they
failed. Then they <em>quacked</em> some
more, and after a long talk the
whole of them went to one side
of the crate. As many as could
thrust their necks underneath it,
and the rest pushed them forward
from behind. A good
push, a strong push, up went the
crate a little way, and out waddled
the little prisoner. I want
to know if they didn&#8217;t reason
that out, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE BALDPATE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
We would have you to wit, that on eggs though we sit,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And are spiked on a spit, and are baked in a pan,</span><br />
Birds are older by far than your ancestors are,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made love and made war, ere the making of man!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">&mdash;Andrew Lang.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="t" title="" />
</div>
<p>HERE is much variation in the
plumage of adult males of this
species of Widgeon, but as
Dr. Coues says: &ldquo;The bird
cannot be mistaken under any condition;
the extensive white of the under
parts and wings is recognizable at
gun-range.&rdquo; The female is similar,
but lacks the white crown and iridescence
on the head.</p>

<p>The Baldpate ranges over the whole
of North America. In winter it is
common in the Gulf states and lower
part of the Mississippi Valley. Cooke
says it breeds chiefly in the north, but is
known to nest in Manitoba, the Dakotas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois,
and Texas. Throughout the whole of
British America, as far north as the
Arctic ocean, it is very abundant. In
October and April it visits in large
numbers the rivers and marshes, as
well as both sea coasts of the northern
United States, and is much sought by
hunters, its flesh being of the finest
quality, as when in good condition it
cannot easily be distinguished from
that of the Canvas-back. It is regarded
by hunters as a great nuisance. It is
not only so shy that it avoids the points
of land, but by its whistling and confused
manner of flight is said to alarm
the other species. During its stay in
the waters of the Chesapeake, it is the
constant companion of the Canvas-backs,
upon whose superiority in diving
it depends in a large degree for its
food, stealing from them, as they rise
to the surface of the water, the tender
roots of the plant of which both are so
fond&mdash;<em>vallisneria</em> grass, or wild celery.
The Baldpate is said to visit the rice
fields of the south during the winter
in considerable numbers. It winters
in the Southern states, Mexico, and
the West Indies. In the north, the
Widgeon exhibits a greater preference
for rivers and open lakes than most
of the other fresh-water Ducks.</p>

<p>The favorite situation of the nest is
remarkable, for while the other Ducks&mdash;except,
perhaps, the Teal, according
to Mr. Kennicott&mdash;choose the
immediate vicinity of water, he found
the Baldpate always breeding at a
considerable distance from it. Several
of the nests observed on the Yukon
were fully half a mile from the nearest
water. He invariably found the nest
among dry leaves, upon high, dry
ground, either under large trees or in
thick groves of small ones&mdash;frequently
among thick spruces. The nest is
small, simply a depression among the
leaves, but thickly lined with down,
with which after setting is begun, the
eggs are covered when left by the
parent. They are from eight to twelve
in number, and pale buff. The food of
the Baldpate consists of aquatic insects,
small shells, and the seeds and roots of
various plants.</p>

<p>The call of this bird is a plaintive
whistle of two and then three notes
of nearly equal duration. Col. N. S.
Goss states that, as a rule, Widgeons
&ldquo;are not shy, and their note, a sort of
<em>whew, whew, whew</em>, uttered while feeding
and swimming, enables the hunter
to locate them in the thickest growth
of water plants.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WOOING BIRDS&#8217; ODD WAYS.</h2>

<p>f all the interesting points on
which Mr. Dixon touches
in his &ldquo;Curiosities of Bird
Life,&rdquo; perhaps none is more
remarkable than the strange
antics in which some birds indulge,
especially at the pairing season. With
what odd gestures will a smartly
dressed Cock sparrow, for instance,
endeavor to cut a good figure in the
eyes of his demure and sober-tinted
lady-love!</p>

<p>To a similar performance, though
with more of dignity and action about
it, the Blackcock treats his wives, for,
unlike the better conducted though
often much calumniated sparrow, he
is not satisfied with a single mate. One
of the most characteristic of spring
sounds on Exmoor, as evening darkens,
or, still more, in the early hours
of the morning, is the challenge of
the Blackcock. In the month of April
he who is abroad early enough may
watch, upon the russet slopes of
Dunkery, a little party of Blackcock
at one of their recognized and probably
ancestral meeting-places, by one of the
little moorland streams, or on the wet
edge of some swampy hollow. Each
bird crouches on a hillock, in the
oddest of attitudes&mdash;its head down, its
wings a-droop, its beautiful tail raised&mdash;and
utters at intervals strange,
almost weird notes, sometimes suggestive
of the purr of a Turtle-dove, and
sometimes more like the cry of chamois.</p>

<p>Presently an old cock, grand in his
new black coat, will get up and march
backward and forward with his neck
stretched out and his wings trailing on
the ground. Now he leaps into the
air, sometimes turning right round
before he alights, and now again he
crouches close upon his hillock. It is
said that in places where black game
are few a single cock will go through
all this by himself, or at least with
only his wives for witnesses. But if
there are more cocks than one, the
proceedings generally end with a
fight. Where the birds are numerous
the young cocks, who are not allowed
to enter the arena with their elders, hold
unauthorized celebrations of their own.</p>

<p>There are many birds which thus,
like higher mortals, have their fits of
madness in the days of courtship. But
there are some, such as the spur-winged
Lapwing of La Plata, which are, like
the lady in the song, so fond of dancing,
especially of what the natives call
their serious dance, meaning a square
one, that they indulge in such performances
all the year, not in the daytime
only, but even on moonlight
nights. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Mr. Hudson, who
tells the story, &ldquo;a person watches any
two birds for some time&mdash;for they
live in pairs&mdash;he will see another Lapwing,
one of a neighboring couple,
rise up and fly to them, leaving his
own mate to guard their chosen
ground, and instead of resenting this
visit as an unwarranted intrusion on
their domain, as they would certainly
resent the approach of almost any other
bird, they welcome it with notes and
signs of pleasure. Advancing to the
visitor, they place themselves behind
it; then all three keeping step, begin
a rapid march, uttering resonant drumming
notes in time with their movements;
the notes of the pair behind
them being emitted in a stream, like a
drum roll, while the leader utters loud
single notes at regular intervals. The
march ceases; the leader elevates his
wings and stands motionless and erect,
still uttering loud notes, while the
other two with puffed-out plumage,
and standing exactly abreast, stoop
forward and downward until the top
of their beaks touch the ground, and,
sinking their rhythmical voices to a
murmur, remain for some time in this
posture. The performance is then over
and the visitor goes back to his own
ground and mate, to receive a visitor
himself later on.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>London Daily News.</em></p>

<h2>THE PURPLE FINCH.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p class="center">
&ldquo;The wind blows cold, the birds are still,<br />
And skies are gray.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 79px;">
<img src="images/imgp.png" width="79" height="80" alt="P" title="" />
</div>
<p>URPLE GROSBEAK, Crimson
Finch, Strawberry
Bird, and Linnet are some
of the common names by
which this bird of bright
colors, sweet song, and sociable disposition
is known. It is very numerous
in New England, but is found nesting
regularly in the northern tier of states,
North and South Dakota, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, etc., northward,
and it is said to breed in northern
Illinois. In Nova Scotia it is exceeding
abundant.</p>

<p>Robert Ridgway says he first made
the acquaintance of the Purple Finch
at Mt. Carmel, in mid-winter, &ldquo;under
circumstances of delightful memory.
The ground was covered with snow,&mdash;the
weather clear and bright, but cold.
Crossing a field in the outskirts of the
town, and approaching the line of tall,
dead rag-weeds which grew thickly in
the fence corners, a straggling flock of
birds was startled, flew a short distance,
and again alighted on the tall weed-stalks,
uttering as they flew, a musical,
metallic <em>chink, chink</em>. The beautiful
crimson color of the adult males,
heightened by contrast with the snow,
was a great surprise to the writer, then
a boy of thirteen, and excited intense
interest in this, to him, new bird. On
subsequent occasions during the same
winter, they were found under like
circumstances, and also in &lsquo;sycamore&rsquo;
or buttonwood trees, feeding on the
small seeds contained within the balls
of this tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Brewer says that the song of the
Purple Finch resembles that of the
Canary, and though less varied and
powerful, is softer, sweeter, and more
touching and pleasing. The notes
may be heard from the last of May
until late in September, and in the
long summer evening are often continued
until it is quite dark. Their
song has all the beauty and pathos of
the Warbling Vireo, and greatly
resembles it, but is more powerful and
full in tone. It is a very interesting
sight to watch one of these little performers
in the midst of his song. He
appears perfectly absorbed in his work,&mdash;his
form is dilated, his crest is
erected, his throat expands, and he
seems to be utterly unconscious of all
around him. But let an intruder of
his own race appear within a few feet
of the singer, the song instantly ceases,
and in a violent fit of indignation, he
chases him away. S. P. Cheney says
that a careful observer told him that
he had seen the Linnet fly from the
side of his mate directly upward fifteen
or twenty feet, singing every instant
in the most excited manner till he
dropped to the point of starting. The
Yellow-breasted Chat has a like performance.
See Vol. II of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>,
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30965/30965-h/30965-h.htm#Page_238">p. 238</a>.</p>

<p>The nest of the Finch is usually
placed in evergreens or orchard trees, at
a moderate distance from the ground.
It is composed of weed-stalks, bark
strips, rootlets, grasses, and vegetable
fibres, and lined with hair. The eggs
are four or five in number, dull green,
and spotted with dark brown.</p>

<h2>THE RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
A little Woodpecker am I,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And you may always know</span><br />
When I am searching for a worm,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For tap, tap, tap, I go.</span></p>


<p>Oh yes, I am proud of my appearance,
but really I am not
proud of my name. Sometimes
I am called the &ldquo;Zebra Bird,&rdquo;
on account of the bands of white
and black on my back and wings.
That is a much prettier name, I
think, than the Red-bellied
Woodpecker, don&#8217;t you? Certainly
it is more genteel.</p>

<p>I know a bird that is called the
Red-eyed Vireo, because his eyes
are red. Well, my eyes are
red, too. Then why not call me
the Red-eyed Woodpecker?
Still the Woodpeckers are such
a common family I don&#8217;t much
care about that either.</p>

<p>In the last <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30626/30626-h/30626-h.htm#Page_46">February</a> number
of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> that saucy red-headed
cousin of mine had his picture
and a letter. Before very long
the Red-cockaded Woodpecker
will have his picture taken too,
I suppose.</p>

<p>Dear, dear! If all the Woodpeckers
are going to write to
you, you will have a merry time.
Why, I can count twenty-four
different species of that family
and I have only four fingers, or
toes, to count on, and you little
folks have five. There may be
more of them, Woodpeckers I
mean, for all I know.</p>

<p>Speaking about toes! I have
two in front and two behind.
There are some Woodpeckers
that have only three, two in front
and one behind. It&#8217;s a fact, I
assure you. I thought I would
tell you about it before one of
the three toed fellows got a
chance to write to you about it
himself.</p>

<p>I am not so shy and wary a
bird as some people think I am.
When I want an insect, or worm,
I don&#8217;t care how many eyes are
watching me, but up the tree I
climb in my zigzag fashion,
crying <em>chaw-chaw</em>, or <em>chow-chow</em> in
a noisy sort of way. Sometimes
I say <em>chuck, chuck, chuck</em>! The
first is Chinese, and the last English,
you know. You might
think it sounded like the bark of
a small dog, though.</p>

<p>I am fond of flies and catch
them on the wing. I like ripe
apples, too; and oh, what a <em>good</em>
time I have in winter raiding
the farmer&#8217;s corn crib! I have
only to hammer at the logs with
my sharp bill, and soon I can
squeeze myself in between them
and eat my fill. I understand
the farmer doesn&#8217;t like it very
much.</p>

<h2>THE RED BELLIED WOODPECKER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/imgz.png" width="96" height="80" alt="Z" title="" />
</div>
<p>EBRA BIRD&rdquo; is the
name by which this
handsome Woodpecker
will be recognized by
many readers. Some
regard it as the most beautiful of the
smaller species of its tribe. As may be
seen, the whole crown and nape are
scarlet in the male. In the female
they are only partly so, but sufficiently
to make the identification easy. A
bird generally of retired habits, seeking
the deepest and most unfrequented
forests to breed, it is nevertheless often
found in numbers in the vicinity of
villages where there are a few dead and
partially decayed trees, in which they
drill their holes, high up on a limb, or
in the bole of the tree. When engaged
in hammering for insects it frequently
utters a short, singular note, which
Wilson likens to the bark of a small
dog. We could never liken it to anything,
it is so characteristic, and must
be heard to be appreciated. <em>Chaw,
chaw</em>, repeated twice, and with vigor,
somewhat resembles the hoarse utterance.</p>

<p>Prof. D. E. Lantz states that this
species in the vicinity of Manhattan,
Kansas, exhibits the same familiarity
as the Flicker, the Red-headed and
Downy Woodpeckers. About a dozen
nests were observed, the excavations
ranging usually less than twenty feet
from the ground. One nest in a burrow
of a large dead limb of an elm
tree was found May 12, and contained
five eggs. The birds are very much
attached to their nests. If the nest is
destroyed by man or beast, the birds
almost immediately begin excavating
another nest cavity for the second set,
always in the vicinity of the first nest,
often in the same tree.</p>

<p>In its search for food, the &ldquo;Zebra
Bird,&rdquo; regardless of the presence of
man, climbs in its usual spiral or zigzag
manner the trees and their branches
boldly uttering now and then its
familiar <em>chaw, chaw</em>, darting off occasionally
to catch a passing insect upon
the wing. Its flight is undulating, and
its habits in many respects are like
those of the Red-headed, but it is not
so much of an upland bird, or lover of
berries and fruits, and therefore more
respected by the farmer. In contest
with the Red-head it is said to be
invariably vanquished.</p>

<p>The North American family of
Woodpeckers&mdash;consisting of about
twenty-five species&mdash;is likely to be
brought together in <span class="smcap">Birds</span> for the first
time. We have already presented several
species, and will figure others as we
may secure the finest specimens. Occasionally
a foreign Woodpecker will
appear. About three hundred and
fifty species are known, and they are
found in all the wooded parts of the
world except Australia and Madagascar.</p>

<h2>A FORCED PARTNERSHIP.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>A pair of Robins had made their
nest on the horizontal branch of an
evergreen tree which stood near a
dwelling house, and the four young
had hatched when a pair of English
Sparrows selected the same branch for
their nest. When the Robins refused
to vacate their nest, the Sparrows proceeded
to build theirs upon the outside
of the Robin&#8217;s nest. To this the
Robins made no objection, so both
families lived and thrived together on
the same branch, with nests touching.
The young of both species developed
normally, and in due time left their
nests. The branch bearing both nests
is now preserved in the college
museum.&mdash;<em>Oberlin College Bulletin.</em></p>

<h2>WHAT IS AN EGG?</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>How many people crack an egg,
swallow the meat, and give it no
further thought. Yet, to a reflective
mind the egg constitutes, it has been
said, the greatest wonder of nature.
The highest problems of organic
development, and even of the succession
of animals on the earth, are
embraced here. &ldquo;Every animal springs
from an egg,&rdquo; is a dictum of Harvey
that has become an axiom.</p>

<p>In an egg one would suppose the
yolk to be the animal. This is not so.
It is merely food&mdash;the animal is the
little whitish circle seen on the membrane
enveloping the yolk.</p>

<p>We hope to group a number of eggs,
to enable our readers to compare their
size and shape, from that of the
Epyornis, six times the size of an
Ostrich egg, down to the tiny egg that
is found in the soft nest of the Humming-bird.
This gigantic egg is a foot
long and nine inches across, and would
hold as much as fifty thousand Humming-bird&#8217;s
eggs.</p>

<h2>THE SAW-WHET OWL.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p style="margin-left: 9em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;The Lark is but a bumpkin fowl;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sleeps in his nest till morn;</span><br />
But my blessing upon the jolly Owl<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all night blows his horn.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>CURIOUS name for a bird,
we are inclined to say when
we meet with it for the first
time, but when we hear
its shrill, rasping call
note, uttered perhaps at midnight, we
admit the appropriateness of &ldquo;saw-whet.&rdquo;
It resembles the sound made
when a large-toothed saw is being filed.</p>

<p>Mr. Goss says that the natural home
of this sprightly little Owl is within
the wild woodlands, though it is occasionally
found about farm houses
and even cities. According to Mr.
Nelson, it is of frequent occurrence in
Chicago, where, upon some of the most
frequented streets in the residence portion
of the city, a dozen specimens
have been taken within two years. It
is very shy and retiring in its habits,
however, rarely leaving its secluded
retreats until late at eve, for which
reason it is doubtless much more common
throughout its range than is generally
supposed. It is not migratory
but is more or less of an irregular
wanderer in search of food during the
autumn and winter. It may be quite
common in a locality and then not be
seen again for several years. It is
nocturnal, seldom moving about in the
day time, but passing the time in
sleeping in some dark retreat; and so
soundly does it sleep that ofttimes it
may be captured alive.</p>

<p>The flight of the Saw-whet so closely
resembles that of the Woodcock that
it has been killed by sportsmen, when
flying over the alders, through being
mistaken for the game bird.</p>

<p>These birds nest in old deserted
squirrel or Woodpecker holes and small
hollows in trees. The eggs&mdash;usually
four&mdash;are laid on the rotten wood or
decayed material at the bottom. They
are white and nearly round.</p>

<p>In spite of the societies formed to
prevent the killing of birds for ornamenting
millinery, and the thousands
of signatures affixed to the numerous
petitions sent broadcast all over the
country, in which women pledged
themselves not to wear birds or feathers
of any kind on their hats, this is essentially
a bird killing year, and the favorite
of all the feathers is that of the Owl.
There is an old superstition about him
too. He has always been considered
an unlucky bird, and many persons
will not have one in the house. He
may, says a recent writer, like the Peacock,
lose his unlucky prestige,
now that Dame Fashion has stamped
him with her approval. Li Hung
Chang rescued the Peacock feather from
the odium of ill luck, and hundreds of
persons bought them after his visit
who would never permit them to be
taken inside their homes prior to it.
So the Owl seems to have lost his ill
luck since fair woman has decided that
the Owl hat is &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The small size of the Saw-whet and
absence of ears, at once distinguish
this species from any Owl of eastern
North America, except Richardson&#8217;s,
which has the head and back spotted
with white, and legs barred with
grayish-brown.</p>

<h2>THE SAW-WHET OWL.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaims Bobbie.
&ldquo;Here&#8217;s another Owl. I never
knew there were so many different
species, mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mamma smiled at that word
&ldquo;species.&rdquo; It was a word Bobbie
had learned in his study of
<span class="smcap">Birds</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Saw-whet Owl</em>,&rdquo; said she,
looking at the picture. &ldquo;A good
looking little fellow, but not
handsome as the Snowy Owl in
the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30666/30666-h/30666-h.htm#Page_211">June</a> number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>was</em> a beauty,&rdquo; assented
Bobbie, &ldquo;such great yellow eyes
looking at you out of a snow
bank of feathers. This little
fellow&#8217;s feet have on black shoes
with yellow soles, not white fur
overshoes like the <em>Snowy Owl&#8217;s</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eyes glow like topaz,
though, just as the others did,&rdquo;
said mamma. &ldquo;Let us see what
he says about himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As stupid as an Owl. That&#8217;s
the way some people talk about
us. Then again I&#8217;ve heard them
say, &lsquo;tough as a b&#8217;iled owl.&rsquo;
B&#8217;iled Owls may be tough, I
don&#8217;t know anything about that,
for I have been too shy and
wary to be caught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a neighbor once who
was very fond of chickens. He
was a Night Owl and said he
found it easy to catch them when
roosting out at night. Well he
caught so many that Mr. Owl
grew very fat, and the farmer
whose chickens he ate, caught,
cooked, and ate him. His flesh,
the farmer said, was tender and
sweet. So, my little friends,
when you want to call anything
&lsquo;tough,&rsquo; don&#8217;t mention the Owl
any more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A foreigner?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, no! I&#8217;m proud to
say I am an American, and so
are all my folks. A branch of
the family, however, lives way up
north in a region where they
sing &lsquo;God save the Queen&rsquo; instead
of the &lsquo;Star Spangled Banner.&rsquo;
They call themselves
English Owls, I guess, because
they live on British soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I sing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly. I can
hoot though, and my <em>Ah-ee, ah-ee</em>,
<em>ah-oo, ah-oo</em>, has a pleasant sound,
very much like filing a saw.
That is the reason they call me
the Saw-whet Owl. My mate
says it doesn&#8217;t sound that way to
her, but then as she hasn&#8217;t any
ears maybe she doesn&#8217;t hear very
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never see me out in the
day time, no indeed! I know
when the mice come out of their
holes; I am very fond of mice,
also insects. I like small birds,
too&mdash;to eat&mdash;but I find them very
hard to catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE BLACK SWAN.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>I advise you little folks to take
a good look at me. You don&#8217;t
often see a Black Swan. White
Swans are very common, common
as white Geese. I only
wish I could have had my picture
taken while gliding through
the water. I am so stately and
handsome there. My feet
wouldn&#8217;t have shown either.</p>

<p>Really I don&#8217;t think my feet
are pretty. They always remind
me when I look down at them of
a windmill or the sails of a vessel.
But if they hadn&#8217;t been
made that way, webbed-like,
I wouldn&#8217;t be able to swim as I
do. They really are a pair of
fine paddles, you know.</p>

<p>There was a time when people
in certain countries thought a
Black Swan was an impossibility.
As long as there were
black sheep in the world, I don&#8217;t
see why there shouldn&#8217;t have
been Black Swans, do you?</p>

<p>Well, one day, a Dutch captain
exploring a river in Australia,
saw and captured four of
the black fellows. That was
way back in sixteen hundred
and something, so that one of
those very Black Swans must
have been my great, great, great,
<em>great</em> grandfather. Indeed he
may have been even greater than
that, but as I have never been
to school, you know, I can&#8217;t very
well count backward. I can
move forward, however, when in
the water. I make good time
there, too.</p>

<p>Well, to go back to the Dutch
captain. Two of the Swans he
took alive to Dutchland and
everybody was greatly surprised.
They said &ldquo;Ach!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Himmel,&rdquo; and many other things
which I do not remember. Since
that time they say the Black
Swans have greatly diminished
in numbers in Australia. You
will find us all over the world
now, because we are so ornamental;
people like to have a
few of us in their ponds and
lakes.</p>

<p>They say that river in Australia
which the captain explored
was named Swan river, and Australia
took one of us for its
armorial symbol. Well, a Black
Swan may look well on a shield,
but no matter how hard you may
pull his tail-feathers, he&#8217;ll never
scream like the American Eagle.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK SWAN.</h2>

<p>USTRALIA is the home of
the Black Swan, and it is
invested by an even greater
interest than attaches to
the South American
bird, which is white. For many centuries
it was considered to be an impossibility,
but by a singular stroke of
fortune, says a celebrated naturalist,
we are able to name the precise day on
which this unexpected discovery was
made. The Dutch navigator William
de Vlaming, visiting the west coast of
Southland, sent two of his boats on
the 6th of January, 1697, to explore an
estuary he had found. There their
crews saw at first two and then more
Black Swans, of which they caught
four, taking two of them alive to Batavia;
and Valentyn, who several years
later recounted this voyage, gives in
his work a plate representing the ship,
boats, and birds, at the mouth of what
is now known from this circumstance
as the Swan River, the most important
stream of the thriving colony of West
Australia, which has adopted this
Swan as its armorial symbol. Subsequent
voyagers, Cook and others, found
that the range of the species extended
over the greater part of Australia, in
many districts of which it was abundant.
It has since rapidly decreased in
number there, and will most likely
soon cease to exist as a wild bird, but
its singular and ornamental appearance
will probably preserve it as a modified
captive in most civilized countries,
and it is said, perhaps even now there
are more Black Swans in a reclaimed
condition in other lands than are at
large in their mother country.</p>

<p>The erect and graceful carriage of
the Swan always excites the admiration
of the beholder, but the gentle bird
has other qualities not commonly
known, one of which is great power of
wing. The <em>Zoologist</em> gives a curious
incident relating to this subject. An
American physician writing to that
journal, says that the first case of fracture
with which he had to deal was
one of the forearm caused by the blows
of a Swan&#8217;s wing. It was during the
winter of 1870, at the Lake of Swans,
in Mississippi, that the patient was
hunting at night, in a small boat and
by the light of torches. In the course
of their maneuvers a flock of Swans
was suddenly encountered which
took to flight without regard to
anything that might be in the way.
As the man raised his arm instinctively
to ward off the swiftly rising birds, he
was struck on his forearm by the wing
of one of the Swans in the act of
getting under motion, and as the action
and labor of lifting itself were very
great, the arm was badly broken, both
bones being fractured.</p>

<p>When left to itself the nest of the
Swan is a large mass of aquatic plants,
often piled to the height of a couple
of feet and about six feet in diameter.
In the midst of this is a hollow which
contains the eggs, generally from five
to ten in number. They sit upon the
eggs between five and six weeks.</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that this
biographical sketch should have been
written and a faithful portrait for the
first time shown on the two hundredth
anniversary of the discovery of the
Black Swan.</p>

<h2>THE SNOWY PLOVER.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>BOUT one hundred species
are comprised in the Plover
family, which are distributed
throughout the world.
Only eight species are
found in North America. Their habits
in a general way resemble those of the
true Snipes, but their much shorter,
stouter bills are not fitted for probing,
and they obtain their food from the
surface of the ground. Probably for
this reason several species are so
frequently found on the uplands instead
of wading about in shallow ponds or
the margins of streams. They frequent
meadows and sandy tracts, where they
run swiftly along the ground in a
peculiarly graceful manner. The
Plovers are small or medium-sized
shore-birds. The Snowy Plover is
found chiefly west of the Rocky
Mountains, and is a constant resident
along the California coast. It nests
along the sandy beaches of the ocean.
Mr. N. S. Goss found it nesting on the
salt plains along the Cimarron River
in the Indian Territory, the northern
limits of which extend into southwestern
Kansas. The birds are described
as being very much lighter in
color than those of California. Four
eggs are usually laid, in ground color,
pale buff or clay color, with blackish-brown
markings. Mr. Cory says the
nest is a mere depression in the sand.
He says also that the Snowy Plover is
found in winter in many of the Gulf
States, and is not uncommon in Northwestern
Florida.</p>

<p>When the female Snowy Plover is
disturbed on the nest she will run over
the sand with outstretched wings and
distressing gait, and endeavor to lead
the trespasser away from it. It sometimes
utters a peculiar cry, but is
usually silent. The food of these birds
consists of various minute forms of life.
They are similar in actions to the
Semi-palmated (see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30523/30523-h/30523-h.htm#Page_6">July</a> <span class="smcap">Birds</span>), and
fully as silent. Indeed they are rarely
heard to utter a note except as the
young are approached&mdash;when they are
very demonstrative&mdash;or when suddenly
flushed, which, in the nesting season,
is a very rare thing, as they prefer to
escape by running, dodging, and squatting
the moment they think they are
out of danger, in hopes you will pass
without seeing them as the sandy lands
they inhabit closely resemble their
plumage in color, and says Mr. Goss,
you will certainly do so should you
look away or fail to go directly to the
spot.</p>

<p>The first discovery of these interesting
birds east of Great Salt Lake
was in June, 1886. A nest was found
which contained three eggs, a full set.
It was a mere depression worked out in
the sand to fit the body. It was without
lining, and had nothing near to
shelter or hide it from view.</p>

<h2>THE LESSER PRAIRIE HEN.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/imge.png" width="100" height="80" alt="E" title="" />
</div>
<p>XTENDING over the Great
Plains from western and probably
southern Texas
northward through
Indian Territory to Kansas is said to
be the habitation of the Lesser Prairie
Hen, though it is not fully known. It
inhabits the fertile prairies, seldom
frequenting the timbered lands, except
during sleety storms, or when the
ground is covered with snow. Its
flesh is dark and it is not very highly
esteemed as a table bird.</p>

<p>The habits of these birds are similar
to those of the Prairie Hen. During
the early breeding season they feed
upon grasshoppers, crickets, and other
forms of insect life, but afterwards upon
cultivated grains, gleaned from the
stubble in autumn and the corn fields
in winter. They are also fond of
tender buds, berries, and fruits. When
flushed, these birds rise from the
ground with a less whirring sound
than the Ruffed Grouse or Bob White,
and their flight is not as swift, but
more protracted, and with less apparent
effort, flapping and sailing along,
often to the distance of a mile or more.
In the fall the birds come together,
and remain in flocks until the
warmth of spring awakes the passions
of love; then, in the language
of Col. Goss, as with a view to
fairness and the survival of the fittest,
they select a smooth, open courtship
ground, usually called a scratching
ground, where the males assemble at
the early dawn, to vie with each other
in carnage and pompous display, uttering
at the same time their love call, a
loud, booming noise. As soon as this
is heard by the hen birds desirous of
mating, they quietly appear, squat upon
the ground, apparently indifferent
observers, until claimed by victorious
rivals, whom they gladly accept, and
whose caresses they receive. Audubon
states that the vanquished and victors
alike leave the grounds to search for
the females, but he omits to state that
many are present, and mate upon the
&ldquo;scratching grounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nest of the Prairie Hen is
placed on the ground in the thick
prairie grass and at the foot of bushes
when the earth is barren; a hollow
is scratched in the soil, and sparingly
lined with grasses and a few feathers.
There are from eight to twelve eggs,
tawny brown, sometimes with an olive
hue and occasionally sprinkled with
brown.</p>

<p>During the years 1869 and 1870,
while the writer was living in southwestern
Kansas, which was then the
far west, Prairie Chickens as they were
called there, were so numerous that
they were rarely used for food by the
inhabitants, and as there was then no
readily accessible market the birds were
slaughtered for wanton sport.</p>

<h2>THE NEW TENANTS.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Elanora Kinsley Marble.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 8%;" />

<p>The next day Mrs. Jenny retired into
the tin pot, and later, when Mr. Wren
peeped in, lo! an egg, all spotted with
red and brown, lay upon the soft lining
of the nest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s quite the prettiest thing in the
world,&rdquo; proudly said Mr. Wren.
&ldquo;Why, my dear, I don&#8217;t believe your
cousin, Mrs. John Wren, ever laid one
like it. It seems to me those spots
upon the shell are very remarkable.
I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the bird
hatched from that shell will make a
name for himself in bird-land some
day, I really shouldn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You foolish fellow,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Wren, playfully pecking him with her
bill, &ldquo;if you were a Goose your Goslings,
in your eyes, would all be Swans.
That&#8217;s what I heard our landlady say
to her husband last night, out on
the porch, when he wondered which
one of his boys would be president of
the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wren chuckled in a truly papa-like
manner and pecked her bill in
return, then fairly bubbling over with
happiness flew to a neighboring limb,
and burst into such a merry roundelay,
one note tumbling over another in
Wren fashion, that every member of
the household came out to hear and
see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; cried Pierre, as Mrs.
Wren left her nest and flew over beside
him, &ldquo;with tail down and head up,
singing as though he were mad with
joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a rapturous song,&rdquo; said
mamma. &ldquo;It reminds me of two almost
forgotten lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&lsquo;Brown Wren, from out whose swelling throat<br />
Unstinted joys of music float.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How well we are repaid for the
litter they made, are we not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sure, mum,&rdquo; said Bridget,
whose big heart had also been touched
by the sweet song, &ldquo;it&#8217;s glad I am, for
sure, that I wasn&#8217;t afther dispossessin&#8217;
your tinents. It&#8217;s innocent craythurs
they be, God bless &#8217;em, a harmin&#8217; ov
no wan. Sthill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; queried her mistress, as
Bridget paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sthill, mum, I do be afther wonderin&#8217;
if the tin pot had been a hangin&#8217;
under the front porch instead of the
back, would ye&#8217;s been after takin&#8217; the
litter so philosophyky like as ye have,
mum, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mistress looked at Bridget and
laughingly shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a pretty hard nut to crack,
Bridget,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Under those
conditions I am afraid I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; What
ever admission she was going to make
was cut short by a burst of laughter
from the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him, mamma, just look at
him,&rdquo; they cried, pointing to Mr. Wren,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
who, too happy to keep still had flown
to the gable at the extremity of the
ridge-pole of the house, and after a
gush of song, to express his happiness
was jerking himself along the ridge-pole
in a truly funny fashion. From
thence he flew into the lower branches
of a neighboring tree, singing and
chattering, and whisking himself in
and out of the foliage: then back to
the roof again, and from roof to tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what makes him so happy,&rdquo;
announced Henry, who, standing upon
a chair, had peeped into the nest.
&ldquo;There&#8217;s a dear little egg in here.
Hurrah for Mrs. Wren!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not touch it,&rdquo; commanded
mamma, &ldquo;but each one of us will take
a peep in turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren&#8217;s bead-like eyes had taken
in the whole proceeding, and with
fluttering wings she stood on a shrub
level with the porch and gave voice
to her motherly anxiety and anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Dee, dee, dee</em>,&rdquo; she shrilly cried,
fluttering her little wings, which in
bird language means, &ldquo;oh dear, oh
dear, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her cries of distress were heard by
Mr. Wren, and with all haste he flew
down beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried he, very nearly
out of breath from his late exertions.
&ldquo;Has that rascally Mr. Jay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she interrupted, wringing
her sharp little toes, &ldquo;It&#8217;s not Mr. Jay
this time, Mr. Wren. It&#8217;s the family
over there, <em>our</em> family, robbing our
nest of its one little egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! nonsense!&rdquo; coolly said Mr.
Wren, taking one long breath of relief.
&ldquo;Why, my dear, you nearly frighten
me to death. You know, or <em>ought</em> to
know by this time, that our landlord&#8217;s
family have been taught not to do such
things. Besides you yourself admit
them to be exceptionally good children
and good children never rob nests.
Fie, I&#8217;m ashamed of you. Really my
heart flew to my bill when I heard
your call of distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren, whose fears were quite
allayed by this time, looked at her
mate scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, with fine sarcasm,
&ldquo;your heart flew into your bill did it?
Well, let me say, Mr. Wren, that if it
had been my mother in distress, father
at the first note of warning, would
have flown to her assistance with his
heart in his <em>claws</em>. He kept them well
sharpened for just such occasions, and
woe to any enemy <em>he</em> found prowling
about his premises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Wren, &ldquo;I
presume he would have attacked Bridget
over there, and the whole family. To
hear you talk, Mrs. Wren, one would
think your father was a whole host in
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so he was,&rdquo; said she, loftily,
&ldquo;I have seen him attack a <em>Bluebird</em>
and a <em>Martin</em> at the same time and put
them both to flight. An <em>Owl</em> had no
terrors for him, and as for squirrels,
why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Wren raised her
wings and shrugged her shoulders in a
very Frenchy and wholly contemptuous
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m a peace-loving sort of a fellow,
that you know, Mrs. Wren, deploring
the reputation our tribe has so justly
earned for fighting, and scolding, and
jeering at everything and everybody.
Indeed they go so far as to say
we trust no one, not even our kindred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
But mark me, Mrs. Wren, mark me, I
say! Should any rascally Jay, neighbor
or not, ever dare approach that
tin pot over yonder, or ever alight
on the roof of the porch, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Wren fairly snorted in his anger,
and standing on one foot, doubled up
the toes of the other and struck it
defiantly at the imaginary foe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say!&rdquo; tauntingly said
Mrs. Wren, &ldquo;you are the sort of fellow
that I heard little Dorothy reading
about the other day. You would fight
and run away, Mr. Wren, that you
might live to fight another day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wren lifted one foot and
scratched himself meditatively behind
the ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, <em>very</em> good, indeed, my dear!
It must have been a pretty wise chap
that wrote that.&rdquo; And Mr. Wren,
who seemed to find the idea very
amusing, laughed until the tears stood
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren smoothed her ruffled
feathers and smiled too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, Jenny,&rdquo; said the good-natured
fellow, &ldquo;what is the use of us
newly married folk quarreling in this
fashion. Think how joyous we were
less than one short hour ago. Come,
my dear, the family have all left the
porch, save Emmett. Let us fly over
there and take a look at our treasure.&rdquo;
And Mrs. Wren, entirely restored to
good humor, flirted her tail over her
back, hopped about a little in a coquettish
manner, then spread her wings,
and off they flew together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren the next day deposited
another egg, and the next, and the
next, till six little speckled beauties
lay huddled together in the cosy nest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly the number of our landlord&#8217;s
family,&rdquo; said she, fluffing her
feathers and gathering the eggs under
her in that truly delightful fashion
common to all mother birds. &ldquo;I am
so glad. I was greatly puzzled to
know what names we should have
given the babies had there been more
than six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that,&rdquo; admitted
Mr. Wren, who in his joy had been
treating his mate to one of his fine
wooing songs, and at length coaxed
her from the nest, &ldquo;but I dare say we
would have named them after some of
our relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; assented Mrs.
Wren, &ldquo;I certainly would have named
one after my dear, brave papa. Mrs.
John Wren says that boys named after
a great personage generally develop
all the qualities of that person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; sniffed Mr. Wren,
&ldquo;that was the reason she named one of
her numerous brood last year after our
rascally neighbor, Mr. Jay, I presume.
Certainly the youngster turned out as
great a rascal as the one he was named
after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren&#8217;s head feathers stood on
end at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the life of me,&rdquo; she said tartly,
&ldquo;I cannot see why you always fly into
a passion, Mr. Wren, whenever I mention
dear papa, or Mrs. John, or in fact
<em>any</em> of my relatives. Indeed&mdash;but
sh-sh! There&#8217;s one of our neighbors
coming this way. I verily believe it
is, oh yes, it is, it <em>is</em>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Mrs.
Wren wrung her toes, and cried <em>cheet,
cheet, cheet</em>, and <em>dee, dee, dee</em>! in a truly
anxious and alarming manner.</p>
